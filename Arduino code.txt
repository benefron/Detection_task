Arduino code for motor control:

Load all relevant libraries (motor drivers)

Define the motors steps RPM and sleep pin
determine intrupt pin for break when motor reachs button
Define microsteps


manual control:
- Move motor back and forth to determine the position for whisker contact
- rotate motor to the object
- manually detrmine initial position with no object
- if needed detrmine distance for catch trails
- define position of the objects (starting from non at 0 angle and moving clockwise positive degree)

automated control:
create random for spins clockwise and counterclockwise until reaching the desired object
choose randomly between the two position of the specific object 
move motor away from object
send feedback when motor reach position
rotate motor
send feedback when motor reachs position
send pulses with object identity (1 - Aluminum 2 - Attenuated 3 - no object)
