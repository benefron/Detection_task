Protocol for running the training

1. Open the Bonsai software Behivior_new.bonsai
2. Insert the animal ID in the main window
3. Determine the buffer count based on the approximate time for trial
4. Open the avisoft USGH software and start acquisition
5. Reset the teensy with the physical button on top
6. Place the objects in the holder based on the map in the arduino code
    a. Every once in a while and for each "test" session change the relative position of the objects 
    b. after changing the physical location correct the arduino code and reload it to the teensy
7. Reattatch the running wheel (should be drying next to the sink)
8. Place the animal on the wheel and attach the headbar to the holder
9. Check that the animal is running easily and that you have some room for the object to reach the whiskers and not toching the wheel. also see that there is room for the lick port to be placed
10. Fasten the screws so the animal is firmly held
11. Start the Bonsai software and close the camera properties window that pops up
12. Press Shift+A to rotate the object to the Aluminum foil
13. Advance the motor using F4 (default 5mm steps) until close to the whiskers
14. With headphones on position the aluminum foil in a manner that the whisker touch it and noise is generated (you can adjust the highet, angle, rotation manually and the distance using f4)
15. Send the motor to starting position using Shift+F and back to the whisker to see if a noise is still generated (if not adjust and check again)
16. Send the motor back to start using Shift+F and press Shift+A until the wheel stops on the second Aluminum position, then press Shift+F again and see that this objects also generates noise when whisked against
17. Add sucrose water to the syringe 
18. Press the selonid until water come out of the lickport (with a tissue to collect the water)
19. Position the lick port below the snout in front of the mouth, and pree Shift+W to release some water and see that the animal is dringking and you can hear the individual licks through the headphones (Make sure thta the contacts are brief and the touch sensor is not constantly active)
20. Turn off the set light and position the camera in a way you can see the mouse over the objects, the whisking pad and the eye.
21. In the Bonsai software, in the camera tab, you can adjust the crop of for a better roi.
22. Close the curtains
23. Load the animal using F10
24. Press the settings node and see that the settings match the loaded settings
25. Press the lick report node and give some water using Shift+W to make sure licks are recorded, if they are not restart the Bonsai software and reload the animal
26. Close the lick report node
27. Turn off the lights in the room and start the session with F12
28. Make sure that the trial is running properly, that the buffer is appropriate and that the protocol doesn't get stuck
29. Close the computer monitor, the entrance curtain and leave the room
30. continue monitoring on using remote desktop


When training is done:
1. Release the animal and put it back in the cage
2. Supplement the animal the needed water
3. If training another animal, clean the wheel 
4. If testing another animal, clean the objects as well

When finishing training for the day:
1. Release the wheel and rinse it with soap and warm water
2. Empty the syringe and run soap water followed by DDW twice
3. Clean feces from the set
